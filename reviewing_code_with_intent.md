# Reviewing Code with Intent

Code reviews are a common (and important) part of the software development process, however, all to often they can be overlooked as a simple "+1" formality.  On the other end of the spectrum, for "important" code reviews, there can be a perception that the only review of value is that of the person most knowledgeable of that piece of code.  While technical expertise is certainly important when it comes to peer code review, there are muliple angle from which to approach a review - all of which can bring value.  While it is certainly possible for one person to cover all perspectives, more often than not, it can be helpful to have multiple reviewers, each who can (and do intentionally) check one or more boxes for thorough review coverage.

In this post, I'd like to explore a few of the perspectives from which to approach a review.

### Review as a functional expert

As mentioned above, one of the most important roles


### Review as a language expert

### Review for api passivity

### Review to learn
